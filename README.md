How to made by Harmonised

This is a config building helper, to use it:

1) Install Node https://nodejs.org/en/
2) download the attached file
3) edit the file, and copy paste the lines you want to add, then modify them how you wish
4) open up your terminal (on Windows, hold shift and right click inside the folder where your start.js lives, and choose Open PowerShell window here)
5) When you are ready to build a config file, type in node start in the Terminal, and press enter. If there are any issues, you will be told, so make sure you read it before closing it
6) You can use the command /pmmo debug searchregistry [type] [search query] to output the search results for items into your console in 3 different formats: raw names, Json formatted names, and Json Builder formatted names

if you need to convert from old builder style, to new, download this, put it in the same place with start.js and do node convert into your terminal, then copy out from converted.js to start.js
